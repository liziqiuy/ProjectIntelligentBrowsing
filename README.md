# CourseProject

The Documentation is in the Final Project Report.pdf file.
The video demo is in the Cs410part1.zip and Cs410part2_demo.zip separately. The first part describes the purpose of this project while the second part is the demo of how to use the tool as well as a test demo of the usage.
Project_progress1.pdf shows the project progress in the middle of the project.
The original proposal is Project Proposal - Final.pdf. There are changes to the proposal, and so we updated the proposal to Final Project Proposal.pdf.
